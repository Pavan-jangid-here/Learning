    "# Why Use Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider how you would write a spam filter using traditional programming techniques.\n",
    "<!-- ![Alt text](Images/1.%20ML%20Traditional.png) -->\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/1. ML Traditional.png\" width=\"700\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "2. First you would look at what spam typically looks like. You might notice that some words or phrases (such as “4U,” “credit card,” “free,” and “amazing”) tend to come up a lot in the subject. Perhaps you would also notice a few other patterns in the sender’s name, the email’s body, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You would write a detection algorithm for each of the patterns that you noticed, and your program would flag emails as spam if a number of these patterns are detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You would test your program, and repeat steps 1 and 2 until it is good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the problem is not trivial, your program will likely become a long list of complex rules—pretty hard to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In contrast, a spam filter based on Machine Learning techniques automatically learns which words and phrases are good predictors of spam by detecting unusually frequent patterns of words in the spam examples compared to the ham examples. The program is much shorter, easier to maintain, and most likely more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/2. ML Modern.png\" width=\"700\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Moreover, if spammers notice that all their emails containing “4U” are blocked, they might start writing “For U” instead. A spam filter using traditional programming techniques would need to be updated to flag “For U” emails. If spammers keep work‐ ing around your spam filter, you will need to keep writing new rules forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In contrast, a spam filter based on Machine Learning techniques automatically noti ces that “For U” has become unusually frequent in spam flagged by users, and it starts flagging them without your intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, Machine Learning can help humans learn (Figure 1-4): ML algorithms can be inspected to see what they have learned (although for some algorithms this can be tricky). For instance, once the spam filter has been trained on enough spam, it can easily be inspected to reveal the list of words and combinations of words that it believes are the best predictors of spam. Sometimes this will reveal unsuspected correlations or new trends, and thereby lead to a better understanding of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applying ML techniques to dig into large amounts of data can help discover patterns\n",
    "that were not immediately apparent. This is called **data mining.**\n",
